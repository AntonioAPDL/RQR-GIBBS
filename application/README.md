# Application package

This directory is the development R package **rqrgibbs** and the reproducibility
layer for the standalone article.

## Native package layout

- **R/rqr_dlm_model.R** provides model builders and composition compatible with
  the public exdqlm FF, GG, m0, C0, df, and dim.df concepts.
- **R/rqr_ffbs.R** provides pure-R reference filtering, smoothing, and FFBS.
- **src/rqr_ffbs.cpp** provides the C++17/RcppArmadillo bottleneck.
- **R/rqr_dlm_fit.R** provides the partially collapsed RQR-DLM sampler and an
  explicit future root-state forecasting contract.
- **R/rqr_numerics.R** provides Cholesky diagnostics and the native GIG(1/2)
  sampler.
- The remaining R files provide fixed-design, DESN, forecasting, VB-screening,
  and oracle routines promoted from the implementation seed.
- **tests/** contains native package gates and copied pinned-exdqlm reference
  tests.
- **scripts/** contains preflight, manifest, simulation, collection, and audit
  scripts.

Install and run the native gates from the repository root:

    make package-install
    make test-native

The pseudo-AL representation augments a loss and is not a response likelihood.
The fixed-W and discount-template modes are exact for their declared fixed
Gaussian evolution priors. Adaptive discounting is experimental, and its fit
objects record **exact_joint_target = FALSE**.

The heavy directories **data_local**, **cache**, **runs**, **logs**, and
**outputs** are ignored by git.
